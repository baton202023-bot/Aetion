# Aetion
A lightweight HTTP-based C2 framework featuring a Python master node and a native VBScript implant with in-memory PowerShell execution.


Choosing a GitHub repository name for a project like **Project Prometheus** depends on whether you want to emphasize its technical function, its "mythological" theme, or its professional utility.

Since "Prometheus" is already a very famous monitoring tool (prometheus.io), you might want a name that distinguishes your C2 framework from the existing ecosystem.

### 1. The "Mythological" Expansion

If you want to stick with the theme of the Greek Titan who brought fire to humanity:

* **Aetion**: (The eagle that visited Prometheus) — Short, unique, and sharp.
* **Caucasus**: (The mountain where he was bound) — Sounds sturdy and foundational.
* **Bring-The-Fire**: A direct nod to the myth.
* **Pro-Methean**: A play on "Professional" and "Prometheus."

### 2. Functional & Descriptive

If you want people to know exactly what it is when they see it in a list:

* **VBS-C2-Core**: Clear and concise.
* **PyVBS-Commander**: Highlights the dual-language nature of the project.
* **Legacy-RAT**: Highlighting that it uses VBScript (a "legacy" but effective language).
* **Web-Orchestrator**: Sounds professional and administrative.

### 3. "Cyber-Noir" & Stealth

For a C2 framework, names that imply hidden activity or light/shadow often fit well:

* **Beacon-Link**: Describes the polling nature of the VBS client.
* **Static-Pulse**: Refers to the HTTP heartbeats.
* **Shadow-Pipe**: Implies a hidden data channel.
* **Lumen-Control**: Keeping the "light" theme of Prometheus but in Latin.

### 4. Recommendation Table

| Style | Name Suggestion | Why it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Direct** | `Prometheus-C2` | Simple, though may conflict with the monitoring tool. |
| **Clever** | `Fire-Stepper` | Refers to the script execution "steps." |
| **Abstract** | `Ember-Node` | Small, lightweight, but part of a fire. |
| **Technical** | `VBS-Http-Tunnel` | Perfect for SEO if you want people to find your code. |

### My Personal Pick: **`Ember-C2`**

It’s short, thematic (a piece of Prometheus's fire), and isn't currently dominated by a major tech product.
